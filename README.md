# Mymacs

This is just a place where I store my emacs.d folder to make it eaiser to move between systems.  Doubtful you'll want to use this repository.  I use a minimal set of packages.  If you're looking for something full featured checkout [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) or [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).
